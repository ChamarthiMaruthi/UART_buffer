# UART with FIFO Buffer

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) with FIFO buffers** for both transmission (TX) and reception (RX).  
The design is written in **Verilog HDL** and simulated using **ModelSim / QuestaSim**. It supports:
- Transmitting and receiving serial data.
- FIFO buffering to handle back-to-back data streams.
- Configurable parity.
- Verified testbench with multiple data inputs.

This project was developed as part of my exploration into digital design, FPGA development, and verification.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Intel Quartus Prime (for synthesis on FPGA)  
- ModelSim / QuestaSim (for simulation)  
- Git  

## 📊 Results
- ✅ UART TX & RX verified with FIFO buffering.  
- ✅ Data transmission verified for multiple bytes.  
- ⚠️ Known issue: FIFO underflow may occur if TX start signal is not aligned (fixed in testbench).
