# EcoMender Bot – e-Yantra 2024

These files are part of our submission for the **e-Yantra Robotics Competition 2024**, under the theme **EcoMender Bot**.

The project involves Verilog HDL-based design and simulation on an Intel FPGA. Tasks include frequency scaling, PWM generation, and color detection using FSM logic interfaced with a simulated TCS3200 color sensor.
